## Description
This is a project for BeaverHacks Fall 2024 at Oregon State University.

Our inspiration was to create a useful tool for our community of OSU CS post-bacc students. 
We wanted a course planner that is easy to use and functional. Our app enforces pre-requisites and also the terms during which electives are offered. It also shows how many courses a student has planned versus total required courses. We hope this app helps our fellow post-bacc students plan their courses. 

## Run the App

The app is deployed on GitHub Pages: [Beaver Course Planner](https://evacgriffin.github.io/beaver-course-planner/).

## Usage

Students can click "Add Term Card" to add a new term to their course plan.

Students can select a core class or elective class card by dragging + dropping the card into a term.

Prerequisites: The app enforces prerequisites. If a student tries to drop a card but 
prerequisites are not met in pervious terms, the card will not be dropped into that term.

Terms: The app enforces terms during which courses are offered. If a student tries to drop a course into a term
during which the course is not offered, the course card will not be dropped.

To remove a course from a term, students can drag and drop a card onto the trash can icon.

All changes made are saved in the local storage. The changes are preserved when the page is refreshed.

## Roadmap

We wanted to incorporate several more features that we did not get to during the hackathon.
- [ ] Prevent term cards for duplicate term/year from being created   
- [ ] Make the UI responsive to different size screens
- [ ] Add an animation or pop up notification when total course count is met
- [ ] When a term card is deleted, automatically fill the missing term slot when the next new term card is created
- [ ] Add more information on hover to the course cards, such as course title, description, terms offered information
- [ ] Add feedback on why a course cannot be added
- [ ] Dark mode
